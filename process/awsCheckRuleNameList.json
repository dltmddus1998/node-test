These reports can be used with other services such as AWS Cost Explorer - for graphical analysis of your costs and spending forecasts, or AWS CloudWatch and SNS - for custom billing alerts in the event of going above your customer-set threshold.

These reports are available within your Cloud Conformity account together with your AWS cost breakdown and other useful cost-based analytics.Note: If the AWS Multiple Account Billing strategy is used, you will need to enable Detailed Billing only for the AWS master billing account.

A placement strategy is an algorithm for selecting EC2 instances for task placement or tasks for termination. The recommended task placement strategies for your Amazon ECS services are 'Spread' and 'Binpack'. The 'Spread' placement strategy will ensure that your tasks are placed evenly based on the specified value, providing redundancy within the ECS service and thus better reliability. The 'Binpack' strategy places tasks on container instances so as to leave the least amount of unused memory or CPU (but still able to run the tasks). This strategy minimizes the number of Amazon ECS container instances in use, resulting in cost efficiency."

AWS Network Firewall is a stateful, managed network firewall and intrusion detection service that enables you to inspect and filter traffic to, from, or between your Amazon VPCs.You can manage AWS Network Firewall with the following main components:Firewall – a network firewall connects the Amazon VPC that you want to protect to the protection behavior that is defined in a firewall policy. For each Availability Zone (AZ) where you want protection, you provide the network firewall with a public subnet that's dedicated to the firewall endpoint. To use the network firewall, you simply update the VPC route tables to send incoming and outgoing traffic through the firewall endpoints.Firewall policy – a firewall policy defines the behavior of the network firewall inside a collection of stateless and stateful rule groups. You can associate each network firewall with only one firewall policy, but you can use a firewall policy for more than one firewall.Rule group – a rule group represents a collection of stateless or stateful rules that define how to inspect and handle network traffic. The rules configuration includes 5-tuple, domain name, and Suricata-based filtering. Suricata is an open-source network IPS that includes a standard rule-based language for traffic inspection."

When DeactivateMFADevice event is triggered, the system decommissions the specified MFA device and removes it from association with the IAM user name for which it was originally enabled, removing the extra layer of protection, set for the IAM user to achieve stronger authentication. An IAM user is an identity created for your Amazon Web Services account that has specific custom permissions (for example, permissions to create and configure IAM roles). You can use an IAM user name and password to sign in to your AWS Management Console to access all or your AWS resources or just a certain service or resource (by implementing the principle of least privilege). As a security best practice, it is always recommended to supplement your usual IAM user names and passwords with a one-time passcode during authentication. This method is known as Multi-Factor Authentication and allows you to enable extra security for your Amazon IAM users. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple and efficient method of verifying your IAM user identity by requiring an authentication code generated by a virtual or hardware device, used in addition to your usual access credentials (i.e. username and password). The MFA device signature adds an extra layer of protection on top of your existing user credentials making your AWS account virtually impossible to breach without the unique code generated by the device. However, in large organizations or multi-tier AWS environments with tens or hundreds of users, to secure the access to Amazon cloud resources, it is absolutely necessary to monitor any request made to decommission the MFA device associated with the IAM user. For example, a privileged IAM user within your organization account is having trouble signing in with a Multi-Factor Authentication device so the user deactivates the device to be able to sign in without using MFA. The user might do this as a temporary solution while the MFA device is replaced. To ensure that a new MFA device is enabled as soon as possible and associated with the involved IAM user, you need to be notified first about the event. Cloud Conformity RTMA will detect the DeactivateMFADevice event and send notifications to the recipients defined within your Cloud Conformity account settings. The communication channels for sending these notifications can be easily configured within Cloud Conformity account. The list of supported communication channels that you can use to receive notification event alerts are Email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty, ServiceNow and Zendesk. Cloud Conformity strongly recommends using this RTMA feature to ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication stays enabled 24/7 for privileged IAM users (users with access to certain AWS resources or that are exposed to sensitive data) in order to maintain a secure access to your Amazon Web Services account and adhere to security best practices."

Cloud Conformity can detect in real time any successful and unsuccessful AWS Management Console sign-in events triggered by IAM and federated users. An IAM user is an identity created for your Amazon Web Services account that has specific custom permissions (for example, permissions to manage RDS database instances within a particular region). You can use an IAM user name and password to sign in to your AWS Management Console in order to access all your provisioned resources - when the user has admin-level privileges, or to access a certain service or resource - when the user has a specific set of permissions that follows the principle of least privilege. A federated user is an entity managed externally that can be authorized to access AWS service APIs and AWS resources. For example, you can authorize a federated user to call AWS CloudFormation APIs as an alternative to creating IAM users to use CloudFormation. The Cloud Conformity RTMA engine integrates with Amazon CloudTrail service which records the attempts to sign in to the AWS Management Console. All AWS IAM user sign-in attempts (successes and failures), all federated user sign-in events (successes and failures) and all successful AWS root account sign-in attempts (root sign-in failures are not detected) generate records in CloudTrail log files. The RTMA engine scans the CloudTrail log files for entries associated with these sign-in events, including the IP address of the entity signing in and whether MFA was enforced for that sign-in, then sends notifications to the recipients defined in the Cloud Conformity account settings.

Shield works in conjunction with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), CloudFront and AWS Route 53 to protect your applications from different types of DDoS attacks such as TCP connection attacks, volumetric attacks, fragmentation and application attacks using amplification methods like DNS Reflection and Chargen Reflection. Shield service is implemented by default on all AWS edge locations to mitigate DDoS attacks and provides two tiers of service - Standard and Advanced:AWS Shield Standard is automatically available to all AWS customers at no extra cost. The Standard tier protects your applications from 96% of the most common DDOS attacks, including SYN/ACK floods, Reflection attacks and HTTP slow reads. This layer of protection is applied transparently to your Elastic Load Balancers, CloudFront CDN distributions and Route 53 DNS resources.AWS Shield Advanced provides intelligent attack detection, mitigation for DDoS attacks initiated at application/network layer and additional mitigation capability for volumetric attacks. Once the Advanced tier is activated, you will get 24/7 access to Amazon DDoS Response Team (DRT) for custom mitigation during attacks, detailed visibility into DDoS events with advanced real time metrics and reports, and cost protection to guard against bill spikes in the aftermath of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) service is also included at no additional cost within the AWS Shield Advanced plan."

A Trusted Advisor check contains a detailed description of the recommended best practice, a set of alert criteria described using color coding: Green (no issues), Yellow (an investigation is required) and Red (an action is required), guidelines for action, and a list with links to useful resources on the topic. AWS Trusted Advisor integrates seamlessly with Cloud Conformity so that you can receive the checks (for one or more AWS accounts) on your Cloud Conformity dashboard.
